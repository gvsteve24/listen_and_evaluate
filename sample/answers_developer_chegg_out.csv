1,True,"“I recently graduated with a degree in computer science and am really excited about the prospect of this position. I have interned with a few mid-size companies and was able to work closely with their mobile developers. I also have a lot of experience with online code repositories, and I love to contribute as much as I can.”"
2,True,"“I would say that people would describe me as a good communicator because I’m always able to articulate people’s needs, whether it be clients or my teammates. I’m able to quickly pick up on subtle hints and nonverbal clues, and I believe this has helped contribute to my success.”"
3,True,"“When I first started at my internship, the onboarding process wasn’t very thorough, and the initial training for developers left a lot to be desired. After sharing my concerns with my trainer, I was able to help develop better resources for new employees as well as restructure the program entirely. I feel like this showed both my initiative and my problem-solving abilities.”"
4,True,"“I’m highly motivated and am extremely passionate about developing. I am known for completing projects ahead of deadlines, and I feel this is especially important when things are constantly evolving and changing. I take initiative and am always coming up with various ways to solve a problem without needing to wait for direction. I also am always up-to-date with the newest trends and am willing to try the latest thing.”"
5,True,"“I would say my biggest weakness is that I’m a recent graduate and don’t have a lot of work experience, but I’m a fast-learner and am highly adaptable. I’m up-to-speed with the latest programming trends and have a fresh perspective. I know I have enthusiasm for the work, and I will bring my strong work ethic and commitment every day.”"
6,True,"“My preferred programming language is Python because it’s easy for a beginner to pick up and it has a lot of excellent libraries. The support libraries greatly reduce time spent on coding, and I find it helps me be creative yet efficient.”"
7,True,"“A class defines the characteristics of a certain type of object such as which messages they will respond to and what form of response they will take. On the other hand, a super-class is the basis of the class under consideration.”"
8,True,"“A default constructor either has no arguments, or all of the arguments have default argument values. A conversion constructor accepts one argument of a different type and uses this as a way to infer conversion rules for a class.”"
9,True,“C++ supports the object-oriented programming paradigm while C is based on structured programming. I prefer C++ due to its object-oriented nature but also the fact that almost anything can be built using it.”
10,True,"“Multiple inheritance is the process where a subclass can be derived from more than one super-class. Its advantage is that a class can inherit the functionality of more than one base class, but its disadvantage is that it can lead to a lot of confusion when two base classes implement a method with the same name.”"
